## Interface Overview

The backend architecture is divided into several main responsibilities:
- **API Layer** (Flask app routes and handlers)
- **Simulation Engine** (biocircuits modeling and numerical solvers)
- **Data Processing** (input validation, formatting, and response generation)
- **Bundling** (compiled with PyInstaller for standalone deployment)

## Key Dependencies

#### ðŸ§© Core Backend

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `flask` | Web server for serving API routes |
| `numpy` | Numerical operations and matrix manipulation |
| `scipy` | Advanced scientific computing (ODE solvers, etc.) |
| `biological simulation libraries` | Custom biological circuit models and dynamics calculations |

---

## Architecture Notes

The backend focuses on high-performance simulation and clean API exposure:
- Flask routes are minimal and validated for security.
- Simulation logic (ODE solving) is handled using efficient NumPy and SciPy routines.
- Biological models (e.g., Hill functions, promoter logic) are modular and extensible.
- The backend is bundled using **PyInstaller** for seamless integration into the Electron app.
